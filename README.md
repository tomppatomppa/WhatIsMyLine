## Description

This app is designed to help actors easily identify their lines during long shooting days in the studio. With this app, actors can easily access their scripts, highlight their lines without needing to print out hundreds of pages and highlight them manually. Additionally, actors can isolate certain scenes by using the search bar or dropdown menu to filter their script and focus on specific sections. This app is a convenient and efficient tool for actors to prepare for their roles and make the most out of their time on set.
